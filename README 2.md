The backend part of the awesome city savior app.

Fixes left to do :

1. Error handling: There is no error handling mechanism for 404s
    Missing 404 in all urls with only post (missing gets must have a 404)
    Catch-all 404
2. Cleaning up 500 error and adding a format
3. Cleaning up url formats (but being backward compatible)
4. Cleaning up response data types: json, http, rest responses
